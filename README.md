# De-Identification-of-medical-Records

[Work in progress] - Currently, the repository has only ipynb files with rough changes. Cleaned-up python scripts will be added soon.

De-identification of medical records using LLMs. Both Zero-shot and few-shot learning methods are employed to solve the problem. 

1) Studied the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Bard, and PaLM models for zero-shot learning for de-identification task. 

2) Also, we have fine-tuned GPT-3.5, PaLM, and Llama models using a very small dataset (30 and 50 training examples). 

3) Studied the effect of different prompts given to the LLM. We provide brief and detailed prompts and check the performance improvement in each case.
